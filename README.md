# CrossCode Sit Anywhere Mod
Use by default backslash (`\`) to sit. You can still move a bit while sitting to position yourself over an object. Use left bracket ('[') or right bracket (']') to turn your head. Use the same key to return to the default position.

If you have the 'input-api' mod, you will be able to rebind the keys in-game.
